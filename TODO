To do list:

* Make the system do the right thing (withdraw ip neigh /
  ip route / iptables rules) when VMs power off or when
  their network gets detached.
  Right now the rules are only reconfigured when:
  * a VM starts (ancestor VMs get reconfigured)
  * a VM gets unpaused (same as before)
  * a VM network gets attached (same as before)
  * a VM's FW rules get altered (parent ProxyVM and sibling
    VMs get reconfigured, and this reconfiguration only
    affects iptables rules)
* Make the system do the right thing when `static_ip`
  is changed / enabled / disabled, without requiring a
  VM restart.
